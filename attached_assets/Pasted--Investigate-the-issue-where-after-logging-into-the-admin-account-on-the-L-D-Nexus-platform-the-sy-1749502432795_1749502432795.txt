"Investigate the issue where, after logging into the admin account on the L&D Nexus platform, the system displays a 'No Page Found' error. Additionally, verify why newly updated features are not appearing on the admin dashboard post-login.

âœ… Checkpoints:
Admin Route Configuration
Confirm that the admin dashboard route is correctly defined in the frontend and backend.
Ensure routing paths are not broken, renamed, or accidentally removed during recent updates.
Authentication & Authorization Logic
Check if the admin account is properly authenticated and authorized to access the admin routes.
Validate role-based routing for admin users vs. standard users (L&D Professionals, Companies).
Database/User Role Mapping
Ensure the admin credentials in use are correctly mapped to an admin role in the database.
Confirm this role has the correct permissions and access tokens to view the dashboard and all features.
Feature Deployment Sync
Check if the recently updated features were successfully deployed to production.
Make sure the admin dashboard is fetching the latest feature flags, components, and data correctly.
Frontend Cache Issues
Clear frontend/browser cache or use incognito mode to ensure the latest updates are loading.
Confirm there are no version conflicts with old code cached in the browser.
Error Logs & Console
Review browser console logs and backend error logs to trace the 'No Page Found' issue.
Identify any failed API calls or broken components on admin login.
ðŸ§© Solution Plan:
Fix the admin route mapping or permissions if incorrect.
Sync the frontend with the latest deployment ensuring all features are enabled for the admin role.
Retest access using the verified admin credentials.
ðŸ”‘ Admin Credentials for Testing (Use one consistent admin account for control):
Email: admin@ldnexus.com  
Password: Admin@123
Only use this credential for platform control and testing purposes. Disable creation of multiple admin accounts to maintain centralized access.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Ensure the admin account can successfully log in, land on the correct dashboard, and access all the updated features with proper routing and permissions. Identify the root cause, fix the issue, and confirm functionality across staging and production environments."
