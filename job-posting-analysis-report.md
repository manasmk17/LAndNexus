# Job Posting Functionality Analysis Report

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Session Authentication Failure (BLOCKING)
**Status**: Critical - Prevents all authenticated operations
**Root Cause**: Session cookies not persisting between requests
**Evidence**: 
- Each API request creates new session ID instead of reusing existing session
- All authenticated endpoints return 401 Unauthorized despite user login
- Session debugging shows: `Authenticated: false, User in session: None`

### 2. Company Profile Prerequisite (BLOCKING)
**Status**: Critical - Required for job posting
**Issue**: Users must have completed company profile before posting jobs
**API Check**: `GET /api/company-profiles/by-user` must return valid profile
**Frontend Flow**: Job posting form requires `companyProfile.id` to create job

### 3. Authentication Middleware Chain (TECHNICAL)
**Issue**: `isAuthenticated` middleware fails due to session persistence problem
**Location**: Job posting endpoint: `app.post("/api/job-postings", isAuthenticated, ...)`
**Effect**: All job posting attempts return 401 before reaching business logic

## Job Posting Flow Analysis

### Required Prerequisites
1. User must be logged in with valid session
2. User must have `userType: "company"`
3. Company profile must be completed (`companyId` required)
4. Valid job posting data must pass schema validation

### API Endpoint Structure
```
POST /api/job-postings
- Middleware: isAuthenticated (FAILING)
- Validation: insertJobPostingSchema
- Business Logic: Create job with companyId
- Response: Created job object or error
```

### Frontend Form Dependencies
- Company profile data for `companyId`
- Form validation via `jobPostingFormSchema`
- Authentication context via `useAuth()`
- API mutation via React Query

## Specific Error Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Authentication Required
**Error**: "Authentication Error (401): You must be logged in to perform this action"
**Cause**: Session not maintained, `req.user` is undefined
**Solution**: Fix session persistence system

### Scenario 2: Company Profile Missing
**Error**: "Company profile not found"
**Cause**: User hasn't completed company profile setup
**Solution**: Redirect to profile completion

### Scenario 3: Invalid User Type
**Error**: "Only companies can post jobs"
**Cause**: User registered as professional instead of company
**Solution**: Role-based access control

### Scenario 4: Form Validation Errors
**Error**: "Invalid input" with field-specific errors
**Cause**: Missing required fields or invalid data types
**Solution**: Frontend validation improvements

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend Endpoints
- ✅ POST /api/job-postings (endpoint exists)
- ✅ Schema validation implemented
- ✅ Company type checking
- ❌ Authentication middleware failing
- ❌ Session persistence broken

### Frontend Components
- ✅ JobPostForm component implemented
- ✅ Post Job page with routing
- ✅ Form validation schema
- ❌ Authentication state unreliable
- ❌ Error handling incomplete

### Database Schema
- ✅ Job postings table structure correct
- ✅ Company profiles linked properly
- ✅ Required fields defined
- ✅ Constraints and relationships valid

## Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Authentication (PRIORITY 1)
1. Resolve session persistence middleware
2. Ensure passport serialization/deserialization works
3. Verify session cookies are maintained across requests
4. Test authentication state consistency

### Phase 2: Company Profile Flow (PRIORITY 2)
1. Ensure company profile creation works
2. Add proper error messages for missing profiles
3. Implement profile completion workflow
4. Add profile status checks

### Phase 3: Job Posting Validation (PRIORITY 3)
1. Improve frontend form validation
2. Add better error handling and user feedback
3. Implement draft saving functionality
4. Add form field helpers and tooltips

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance (PRIORITY 4)
1. Test complete job posting flow end-to-end
2. Verify all error scenarios handle gracefully
3. Test with different user types and states
4. Performance and usability testing

## Expected Resolution Timeline
- Authentication fixes: 30-45 minutes
- Company profile flow: 15-20 minutes  
- Job posting validation: 10-15 minutes
- Testing and verification: 15-20 minutes
- **Total estimated time**: 70-100 minutes

## Success Metrics
- Company users can successfully create job postings
- Form validation provides clear error messages
- Authentication state persists throughout session
- Job postings appear in listings immediately
- All user flows work without errors
