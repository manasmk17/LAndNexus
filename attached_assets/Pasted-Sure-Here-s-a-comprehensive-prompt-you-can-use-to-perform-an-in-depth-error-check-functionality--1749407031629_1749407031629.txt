Sure! Here's a comprehensive prompt you can use to perform an in-depth **error check, functionality test, and bug identification** for any appâ€”ideal for developers, QA testers, or AI-assisted testing tools:

---

**Prompt:**

> **Perform a comprehensive quality assessment for the app. Your tasks include:**
>
> 1. **Error Checking:**
>
>    * Scan the codebase for syntax errors, runtime errors, and unhandled exceptions.
>    * Flag any deprecated libraries, broken dependencies, or insecure code practices.
>    * Highlight missing or incorrect API integrations.
> 2. **Functionality Testing:**
>
>    * Evaluate all features and user flows for correct functionality (e.g., login, signup, search, navigation, user roles).
>    * Test across different devices, screen sizes, and operating systems for responsiveness.
>    * Simulate edge cases and user input (empty fields, special characters, etc.).
>    * Check integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateway, cloud services).
> 3. **Bug Identification and Categorization:**
>
>    * Identify UI/UX glitches, data mismatches, loading failures, or app crashes.
>    * Categorize bugs by severity (critical, high, medium, low) and suggest probable root causes.
>    * Verify form validations, error messages, and redirections.
> 4. **Performance Evaluation:**
>
>    * Test for load time, memory usage, CPU consumption, and responsiveness.
>    * Identify any performance bottlenecks or lag in high-traffic scenarios.
> 5. **Security & Compliance Check:**
>
>    * Detect vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, weak encryption).
>    * Review permissions, authentication flow, and data protection methods.
>    * Ensure GDPR or applicable regional compliance for data privacy.
> 6. **Suggestions for Improvement:**
>
>    * Recommend optimizations, better coding practices, UI enhancements, or automation points.
>    * Highlight any redundant or unused code or assets.
>
> **Deliverables:**
> A detailed report listing:
>
> * All detected errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities
> * Feature-by-feature functionality status
> * Suggestions for improvement
> * A prioritized action list for fixing issues
