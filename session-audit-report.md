# Session Persistence Technical Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The platform suffers from critical session management failures causing authentication to fail across requests. Each API call generates a new session ID instead of maintaining the existing session, breaking user authentication and causing 401 errors for all authenticated operations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Session ID Generation Issues
- Custom `genid` function in session middleware attempts to extract existing session ID but fails due to cookie signing
- Session cookies are signed with Express secret, but extraction logic doesn't properly unsign them
- Results in new session generation for every request

### 2. Memory Store Limitations
- Using in-memory session store without persistence
- Session data lost on server restart
- No session replication for horizontal scaling

### 3. Cookie Configuration Problems
- Conflicting cookie settings between session middleware and CORS
- Inconsistent sameSite policies
- Missing secure session handling for production environments

### 4. Passport Session Integration
- Session regeneration occurs during passport authentication
- No proper session persistence after login
- Session serialization/deserialization not properly configured

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Session Architecture Rebuild
1. Remove problematic custom session ID generation
2. Implement proper session cookie handling
3. Configure robust session store with persistence
4. Fix passport integration for session continuity

### Phase 2: Authentication Token System
1. Implement JWT-based session tokens alongside express-session
2. Add token refresh mechanism
3. Secure token storage and transmission
4. Fallback authentication for session recovery

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
1. End-to-end authentication flow testing
2. Session persistence across page refreshes
3. Multi-tab session consistency
4. Mobile device session handling
