# Platform Link and Image Scan Report

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. RESOLVED: Image Serving Infrastructure
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Static file serving for uploads was missing
- **Solution**: Added `/uploads` static file serving before route registration
- **Test**: `curl -I http://localhost:5000/uploads/profiles/1744923747758-995976456.jpg` returns 200 with proper image/jpeg content-type

### 2. Broken External Image Links
- **Company Profile**: `https://example.com/logo.png` returns 404
- **Impact**: Company logos fail to load on profiles and listings
- **Location**: company_profiles.logo_url field

### 3. Missing Profile Images
- **Professional Profiles**: Many have null profile_image_url
- **Company Profiles**: Mixed storage between logo_url and logo_image_path
- **External Dependencies**: Some profiles use https://i.pravatar.cc/150 (working but external dependency)

### 4. Database Schema Inconsistencies
- Professional profiles: `profile_image_url` field
- Company profiles: `logo_url` AND `logo_image_path` fields
- Inconsistent image storage patterns across profile types

## Testing Profile Upload Functionality

### Upload Infrastructure Present
- Multer configured for profile images (25MB limit)
- File filter accepts: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp
- Storage: uploads/profiles/ directory
- Gallery uploads: uploads/gallery/ directory

### Upload Routes Found
- POST /api/professional-profiles (with profileImage upload)
- PUT /api/company-profiles/:id (with profileImage upload)
- POST /api/professionals/me/gallery (gallery images)

## Next Steps for Complete Scan
1. Test profile upload endpoints with authentication
2. Check all internal route links across pages
3. Validate image path storage in database
4. Test image display components across platform
5. Check resource file uploads and serving
