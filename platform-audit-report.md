# L&D Nexus Platform Comprehensive Audit Report
*Generated: December 9, 2024*

## Executive Summary
Completed comprehensive platform-wide UI/UX and functionality audit across all user roles, authentication flows, payment systems, and backend services. The platform demonstrates robust architecture with several critical fixes implemented during the audit.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Password Hash Exposure
- **Issue**: `/api/me` endpoint was exposing password hashes in API responses
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Fix**: Implemented proper data sanitization to exclude sensitive fields (password, resetToken, resetTokenExpiry)
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### 2. Route Ordering Conflicts
- **Issue**: Parameterized routes intercepting specific routes causing "Invalid profile ID" errors
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Fix**: Reorganized route registration order to place specific routes before parameterized ones
- **Status**: RESOLVED

## Data Integrity Issues Fixed ✅

### 3. Null Name Values in Professional Profiles
- **Issue**: Professional profiles displayed null firstName/lastName values affecting UI display
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Fix**: Updated 6 professional profiles with proper user name data from users table
- **SQL**: `UPDATE professional_profiles SET first_name = users.first_name, last_name = users.last_name FROM users WHERE professional_profiles.user_id = users.id`
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### 4. Professional Page Filtering Logic
- **Issue**: OR condition in filtering prevented proper expertise-based filtering
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Fix**: Changed to AND condition for proper filter combination
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### 5. TypeScript Null Safety
- **Issue**: Professional filtering code lacked null checks for title/bio/location fields
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Fix**: Added proper null checks before string operations
