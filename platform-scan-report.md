# Platform Link and Image Scan Report

## COMPREHENSIVE SCAN COMPLETED ✅

### 1. RESOLVED: Image Serving Infrastructure
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Static file serving for uploads was missing

- **Test**: All uploaded images now serve correctly with proper content-type headers
- **Verification**: Successfully tested image upload and serving pipeline

### 2. Profile Upload Functionality
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING
- **Test Results**: Successfully uploaded profile image via PUT /api/company-profiles/1
- **File Storage**: Images stored in uploads/profiles/ with unique filenames
- **Database Storage**: Image paths correctly saved to logoImagePath field
- **Serving**: Uploaded images immediately accessible via /uploads/profiles/[filename]

### 4. Image Sources Analysis
- **External Working**: https://i.pravatar.cc/150 (200 OK)
- **External Broken**: https://example.com/logo.png (404 NOT FOUND)
- **Local Uploads**: All working after infrastructure fix
- **Database Records**: Mixed storage patterns identified

### 5. Database Schema Review
- Professional profiles: `profile_image_url` field (external URLs)
- Company profiles: `logo_url` (external) + `logo_image_path` (local files)
- Inconsistent but functional dual storage system

## ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### High Priority
1. **Broken External Logo**: Company profile #1 has broken logo URL (https://example.com/logo.png)
2. **Mixed Storage Pattern**: Inconsistent image storage between profile types
3. **Missing Profile Images**: Many profiles have null image URLs

### Recommendations
1. Update broken external image URLs to use local uploads
2. Standardize image storage pattern across all profile types  
3. Implement image fallback system for missing profile pictures
4. Add image validation and processing for uploads

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS: HEALTHY ✅
- All core API endpoints responding correctly
- Image upload and serving pipeline fully functional
- Static file serving properly configured
- Authentication and CSRF protection working as expected
